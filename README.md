## Professional-Portfolio-

In this project i have created a web application from scratch! i have built a portfolio page, which added to as my progresses. 
I have created this using HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:
My webpage is divided into several sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info. 
Included functioning navigation links at the top of the page to take the user to any of the sections Included a link to a PDF of my resume.
I included a recent photo of myself. The projects presented in the section include a couple of sample projects I have done on for my previous studies.
The applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on. The page was styled for multiple screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones. 
I also included root elements , border shadowing ,hover effects for the various links and the projects on the page and personalized it too.
